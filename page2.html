<p>>be me<p>
<p>>browse 4chan for years<p>
<p>>always liked edgy humor, fit right in with /b/<p>
<p>>start getting more into fetishes<p>
<p>>develop a thing for scat<p>
<p>>tfw no one's into it<p>
<p>>try bringing it up on /b/<p>
<p>>"anon, wtf is wrong with you?"<p>
<p>>tfw even /b/ thinks you're weird<p>
<p>>lurk harder<p>
<p>>start posting anonymously to avoid being "that guy"<p>
<p>>no matter where I go, scat is a no-go<p>
<p>>even on /d/ they judge<p>
<p>>feel like an outsider on the one place I thought would accept me<p>
<p>>mfw /b/ros will laugh at gore but draw the line at scat<p>
<p>>tfw no like-minded degenerate friends<p>
<p>>just want to be loved by my fellow anons<p>
<p>>mfw forever an outcast, even on 4chan<p>

        </div>
        <div class="text-window">
            <h2>I AM HERE FOR THE CHOAS LAWL!</h2>
<p>> Be me, scrolling through /b/ at 3 AM.<p>
<p>> See a thread about normies invading our safe space.<p>
<p>> Anons start posting cringe-worthy stories.<p>
<p>> One guy posts a pic of his "gf" that’s obviously just a body pillow.<p>
<p>> “Bro, that’s not even a real girl. Just a waifu.”<p>
<p>> Other anons start keking and calling him a weeb.<p>
<p>> I decide to throw in a meme.<p>
<p>> Post a Pepe saying “I can’t even.”<p>
<p>> Thread devolves into chaos with everyone roasting each other.<p>
<p>> Suddenly, someone drops a rare Wojak.<p>
<p>> Everyone loses their minds.<p>
<p>> Classic /b/ feels, just another day in the chaos.<p>

            <h2>The Rashy Bum</h2>
<p>>be me<p>
<p>>ultimate basement dweller, living the NEET dream<p>
<p>>haven't showered in... idk, two weeks? three? who cares lol<p>
<p>>smell like a /b/ thread come to life<p>
<p>>tfw BO so strong it could summon a /x/ cryptid<p>
<p>>start noticing a weird tingle in the bum region<p>
<p>>whatever, ignore it, got more important things to do<p>
<p>>like shitposting on /v/ about how every game sucks now<p>
<p>>itch intensifies over time<p>
<p>>tfw chair cushion feels like it’s fusing with my ass<p>
<p>>skin sticking to it like a melted McDonald's cheeseburger wrapper<p>
<p>>try adjusting, but the itch just travels<p>
<p>>eventually, can't resist<p>
<p>>give it a scratch while pretending to listen to my waifu's voice lines<p>
<p>>oh god what have I done<p>
<p>>feels like I just scraped sandpaper over raw hamburger meat<p>
<p>>pull my hand back<p>
<p>>see some weird goo on my finger<p>
<p>>"wtf is that?"<p>
<p>>ignore it, go back to gaming<p>
<p>>this is fine.jpg<p>
<p>>the itch turns into full-blown pain<p>
<p>>start waddling around my room like some kind of mutated penguin<p>
<p>>tfw can’t even sit properly anymore<p>
<p>>bum feels like it’s been through a /b/-tier hell thread<p>
<p>>realize I’ve somehow birthed the dreaded gamer rash<p>
<p>>mfw I have created a monster, and that monster is my own unwashed ass<p>
<p>>start Googling my symptoms<p>
<p>>accidentally go to WebMD<p>
<p>>”you have cancer”<p>
<p>>close tab immediately<p>
<p>>tfw too scared to look at my own butt in the mirror<p>
<p>>start avoiding the thought, put on more hentai in the background to forget<p>
<p>>still in denial, try to tough it out<p>
<p>>apply some crusty old deodorant to it thinking I’m a genius<p>
<p>>the burning intensifies<p>
<p>>tfw literally lit my own ass on fire<p>
<p>>now waddling around like a penguin that stepped in molten lava<p>
<p>>tfw all that’s left of my dignity is slowly dissolving in a gamer chair-shaped puddle of sweat<p>
<p>>panic sets in<p>
<p>>can't go to the doctor, what if they ask how long it’s been since I showered<p>
<p>>they'd probably call the CDC<p>
<p>>try asking for help on /fit/<p>
<p>>"lol just shower, bro"<p>
<p>>tfw even 4chan calls me out for my degenerate hygiene<p>
<p>>now I’ve reached the final stage of denial: doomscrolling /pol/ for no reason<p>
<p>>tfw not even conspiracy theories can save my ass<p>
<p>>finally break down and have to waddle to the bathroom<p>
<p>>look at myself in the mirror<p>
<p>>the sight is unspeakable<p>
<p>>bum looks like the surface of /r9k/’s collective souls: raw, festering, and eternally suffering<p>
<p>>realize it’s time to do the one thing I’ve avoided for weeks<p>
<p>>shower<p>
<p>>walk into the bathroom like it’s the final boss room<p>
<p>>turn on the water<p>
<p>>tfw it hits my body for the first time in forever<p>
<p>>feels like I’m being cleansed by the tears of all the normies I’ve ever hated<p>
<p>>but the water hits my rashy bum<p>
<p>>tfw it burns more than getting roasted on /b/<p>
<p>>mfw I’m finally cleaning myself but at what cost<p>
<p>>the pain is too much, have to cut the shower short<p>
<p>>now sitting in my room, raw ass air-drying, still not entirely sure how I survived<p>
<p>>tfw the battle may have been won but the war against hygiene continues<p>
